# Secureum Race Runner

A browser extension that helps security researchers simulate Secureum races in a realistic environment. Secureum hosts excellent smart contract security challenges at https://ventral.digital/posts/, but their live races fill up quickly. This tool lets you practice these challenges as if you were in a real race.

## Features

- Simulates the real race environment with a 16-minute timer
- Automatically scores your answers when time expires
- Hides solutions until the race is complete
- Tracks your progress with detailed scoring per question
- Provides a clean, distraction-free practice environment

## Why Use This?

While anyone can study Secureum's race questions and solutions on Ventral Digital, this extension recreates the actual race experience by:
- Enforcing the 16-minute time limit
- Hiding solutions until completion
- Calculating scores using the same scoring system as real races
- Eliminating the need for manual timing and scoring
